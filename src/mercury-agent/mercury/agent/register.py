    # Relying solely on dhclient (in the initrd) might be an option and would
    # allow for parsing dhclient.leases.
    # Currently, the preboot environment uses udhcpc, so modifying the script
    # udhcpc calls on renew/bound to publish a cookie with vars set by the dhcp
    # server is an option as well

    # Either process should be configurable. ie,
    #  default_ip_source: simple # use default route
    #                     udhcpc # script in preconfig leaves cookie, parse the cookie
    #                     dhclient # parse /var/lib/dhclient.leases

    # And then there is ipv6, where we'd need to DHCP to get a route-able address
    # subnet, and then heuristically generate an ip address in the subnet, forgoing
    # the explicit need for publishing the address
