        Given I have query details in <query_filename> for entities using the active_computers api
        When I get with parameters in <param_filename> the query_results from a query of active_computers
        Then the active_computers response status is 200 OK
        And the response contains a list of active_computers
        And url parameters to the active_computers api are applied
        And the active_computers entities in the response contain the data from <filename>
